# Negative news based trading strategy

Based on research of the market, my team took the idea of the neagtive news' influence on the investors' sentiment, and use the data obatined from Bloomburg about the news being symboled as negative, and explored the factor that worked the best for our trading strategy, from the data cleaning to statistical analysis and strategy implement and backtest, we tuned the code and our strategy step by step and finally got a satisfying result of sharp ratio at around 1.8. 

After that we used the Boeing crash news and Nike related Negative news etc. as validation to test our trading point and strategy's performance. It shows that in most cases we can predict the trough in short future after the public got the news which matched our final goals.
